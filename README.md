FINDINGS
•	Based on the insights, branch c had the highest revenue and is located in the city Naypyitaw. This may be as a result of local demand and economic activity in the city. The city is also known as the headquarters for several government agencies, this may have an influence on the economic activity.
•	The average revenue generated from regular customers is more than the new customers. This is probably because of the relationship and trust that has been built overtime, loyalty and convenience. They must be happy with the products the supermarket sells, hence the reason for their constant patronage. New customers are probably new to the supermarket or might be visiting the area, hence the reason for the slight difference in revenue.
•	The Female customers tend to buy more of fashion accessories, food and sports and travel products than their male counterpart. Women often have a higher inclination towards fashion accessories, as they may have a strong interest in their personal appearance. They also tend to be more likely to purchase food and beverages product than their male counterpart.  The Male on the other hand, bought more electronics and health based products than the females.
•	Food and beverage is the best-selling product line. Food is a necessity. It is something people need for sustenance, and it accounts for a significant portion of household expenses. It is also an essential consumable good, which means it needs to be steadily replenished from time to time.
•	The time of the day with the highest transaction is in the afternoon, followed by evening. This is because many people find afternoons to be a convenient time to shop due to their availability after work or other daytime commitments. It is the period when individuals have time to visit stores, run errands and make purchases.
•	The year was segmented into 4 quarters to know the most performing time of the year, and Quarter 1 generated the highest revenue for the year. This is probably because people make a lot of purchases during the New Year which is part of the holiday season. Another reason can be because it is the start of the year and people may make annual goals which leads to various purchases.
•	E-wallet is the most used method of payment, followed by cash. This is likely because of the convenience and accessibility it provides to customers. It enables quick transactions, while cash is universally the most accepted form of payment, and it caters for customers with various preferences, even those with limited access to financial services.
•	Food and Beverages has the highest cost of production. It is due to the need for quality ingredients, supply chain fluctuations and its perishable nature that can impact its cost of production. 
•	Due to factors like the cost of manufacturing sports equipment, maintaining quality and safety standards, and the costs involved in planning and promoting travel experiences, including lodging, activities, and transportation, sports and travel products may have the second-highest direct cost of production. Production costs might also rise due to rivalry and the need for creative, high-quality goods and services in these sectors.


RECOMMENDATIONS

•	Profit from the city's government presence and economic activity by adjusting marketing strategies to meet local demand, perhaps by launching special goods or services that are tailored to the tastes of locals and government workers.
•	Establish customer loyalty programs to boost recurring business. To establish a good relationship, concentrate on improving new client’s experience. Offer special discounts to encourage their continuous patronage.
•	Promote targeted marketing campaigns and products that cater to the specific preferences of female customers. Offer promotions and create a personalized shopping experience to further engage and retain this customer segment.
•	Continue to offer a wide variety of premium food and drink products while monitoring changes in consumer tastes. Keep innovating by bringing in new flavors and goods to satisfy changing consumer needs and guarantee a steady supply of necessities.
•	Make the most of staffing during busy times to guarantee effective customer service. Use afternoon and evening hours to your advantage by running promotions or exclusive deals to entice customers to spend more money.
•	Organize strategic marketing campaigns and product launches during the first quarter to leverage the increased consumer spending. Consider offering seasonal discounts or exclusive products to capitalize on the heightened consumer interest during this period.
Also spread out your promotions over the course of the year as opposed to focusing them in one quarter. Create seasonal or themed promotions for each quarter that corresponds with important holidays, events, or customer demands unique to that time frame. For example, you could have back-to-school promotions in Q3 and holiday-themed offers in Q4.
•	Continue encouraging customers who use e-wallets by offering special discounts or other advantages to those who choose to use digital payment methods. To maintain accessibility and convenience for all customers, make sure that traditional methods of payment, such as cash, are available for those customers.
•	Minimize cost by streamlining the supply chain. Investigate cost-effective production methods and sustainable sourcing choices to preserve quality while controlling costs.
 To reduce production costs while maintaining product standards, implement strict quality control measures. To improve supply chain logistics and lower overall production costs, consider forming partnerships.
